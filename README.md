This application is designed to assist beginner drivers with their permit test, license exam, and beyond. Through AI-powered systems and SCDMV-aligned content, your experience is personalized to the fullest extent. To verify your knowledge, built-in quizzes are included in each section along with a "Listen to Lesson" button in case you are on a run or eating breakfast. Not only is theory tested, but your driving performance will also be evaluated since a smooth ride is just as important in road safety. The layout is intended to radiate a gamified feel, suited for teens who may have difficulty staying focused on tasks.
